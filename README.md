Code for AI Coliseum 2021.

Autonomous agents were programmed to work towards a collective goal. Capabilities included:
- pathfinding
- communication
- planning

Some pitfalls of the strategy were:
- units getting stuck in corners
- units swarming the same resource
- inability to know how many units will be needed in the future

Feel free to test at https://www.coliseum.ai/ on the 2021 competition or branch to try to improve our strategy!
